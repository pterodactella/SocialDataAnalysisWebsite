                        <p><br><br> Identifying and studying temporal patterns would help us summarise the evolution of Melbourne microclimate throughout the entire dataset. First let’s take a look at the Average sensor readings per day of week for each
                            of the available categories. <br><br><img src="/graphs/weekday.png" alt=""> <br><br> One can see that the plots above do not show major patterns for the microclimate sensor readings except for the Particulate Air Pollution
                            for both 10 micro meters and 2.5 micro meters. It can be seen that the Particulate Air Pollution for 2.5 micro meters is the lowest on a Sunday. There is not much detail on why this phenomenon happens but it might be caused
                            due to the less vehicle use on Sundays as people tend to spend more time outside in weekend days. <br><br>Further one can dive into the Average readings per week-day hour for each of the categories. <br><br> <img src="/graphs/weekdayhour.png"
                                alt=""> <br><br> The measurements for the following parameters: The Particulate Air Pollution, Ambient Air Temperature and Relative Humidity correspond to the hourly rolled average, as it was stated in the dataset description,
                            however, for the rest of the measurements it is unclear how they were acquired. It seems that Particulate Air Pollution for both air particle sizes is highest on Tuesdays, towards the beginning of the day. The ambient air temperature
                            follows the same pattern for each weekday, being normally a bit higher in the middle of the day. The same can be said for the Average Wind Speed. The Relative Humidity follows the same pattern for every day of the week, seeming
                            to peak more at the beginning of the day. The Barometric Pressure is almost the same regardless of the hour or the day of the week. <br><br> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11879110"> A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>                            estimates that for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter of particulate air pollutant (μg/m3) increase in fine particulate air pollution, there is an associated 4%, 6% and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary and lung
                            cancer mortality, respectively. Moreover, long-term exposure to PM2.5 may lead to plaque deposits in arteries, causing vascular inflammation and a hardening of the arteries which can eventually lead to heart attack and stroke
                            Lastly, we will look into the monthly patterns. Melbourne is located in the Southern Epishere, meaning that June, July and August are winter months and November, December and January are summer months. <br><br> <img src="/graphs/monthly.png"
                                alt=""> <br><br> When Looking at the Particulate Air Pollution for 10 micro meters one can observe that there is a peak registered for the month of January. Higher readings were also registered for the months of May, June,
                            July and December. The high peaks for January and December were expected to record high readings as arid weather is usually <a href="https://blog.breezometer.com/summer-air-pollution-trends">loosening more dust into the air</a>.
                            However, the spikes in May, June and July are a bit harder to explain as these peaks were unexpected. Particulate Air Pollution for 2.5 micro meters can be interpreted in the same way as per 10 micro meters. An exception is
                            the huge spike for January that could be explained by the fact that more dust particles are present in the summer months. The sensors are located in areas of Melbourne that are not that windy throughout the year. Thus the Average
                            wind speed is relatively low. Moreover, the average wind speed tends to be smaller for March, April, May and June. Not much change can be seen for the Barometric Pressure as the average values seem to be constant throughout
                            the year. The sensor locations are quite humid, but one can observe that the Relative Humidity tends to be higher on an average for the winter months. The Ambient Air Temperature, as expected, is higher in the summer months
                            and colder in the winter months. Moreover, it can be observed that it doesn’t go below 10 degrees which can explain the high Relative humidity readings.
