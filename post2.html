                        <p><br><br><br> This blog post will focus into visualising geo data. The geo-location data was acquired from the <a href="https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Microclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4">Micro climate sensor locations</a><br><br>                            Below you have a heat map of the PM2.5 sensor locations throughout the city of Melbourne: <br><br>
                            <iframe src="/graphs/heat_map1.html" class="graphs"></iframe> <br><br> The heat map above displays the air quality sensor locations. It can be observed that a greater number of sensors are located in the South Warfares region.
                            By zooming in one can see that there are four PM2.5 sensors installed in the Melbourne Convention Centre Parking located on the Siddley Street. Now, let’s focus more on the high readings of the small air pollutants by going
                            a step further into the <a href="post1.html">weekly-hourly temporal patterns</a> <br><br> Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that can cause health issues if exposed to it for a long period of time. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11879110"> study </a>                            in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that for every 10 micro grams per cubic meter increase in fine particulate air pollution, there is an associated 4%, 6% and 8% risk of cardiopulmonary and lung cancer
                            mortality. <br><br> <iframe src="/graphs/heat_map2.html" class="graphs"></iframe> <br><br> The heat map presented above displays measurements above 10 micro grams per cubic meter, thus the PM2.5 sensors recorded quite high
                            measurements. By zooming into the Melbourne Convention Centre Parking, one can see that multiple sensors (3-4) are lighting up simulataneously, thus showing that there is likely a high air pollution around the building. Moreover,
                            these high air pollution readings are mostly recorded on week days and mid-Saturday, Sunday being an exception by having less high readings recorded. The high readings could be caused by the fact that a lot of the parking area
                            is being in use by cars. It seems that especially on Tuesdays and Saturdays, a lot of the parking spots might be occupied. The parking is most likely being used by those who are visiting the Melbourne Convention Exhibition
                            Centre. Looking at the Grattan Street one can see that there are a constant number of high readings, in terms of air pollution, throughout the entire week. This could be caused by the constant traffic in the area during weekdays.
                            There are sensors spread around the Town Hall streets, which is a central location of Melbourne. The heat map shows that there a multiple sensors lighting up for longer periods of time, which could mean that the central zone
                            has a higher level of pollutants in the air within a certain time span. Another thing to note is that the Station Swanson on Flinders Street records high air pollution readings throughout most of the week period. This could
                            be due to the fact that the station is placed at the intersection of Flinders Street, where there could be constant traffic. Lastly, let’s have a look at the seasonal development as we previously observed higher average concentrations
                            for the month of January. <br><br> To study the seasonal patterns more closely, we have decided to look at the seasonal weekly development - that is, showing how many high readings of small air pollutants above 11 μg/m3 are
                            recorded throughout the weeks between 2021-2022. <br><br> <iframe src="/graphs/heat_map3.html" class="graphs"></iframe> <br><br> The heat map shows high readings of small air pollutants (>11 micro grams per cubic meter) from
                            the beginning of January 2021 to the final weeks of April. More high readings are also recorded from September until the end of December with peaks in November and December. This is likely caused by the summer months (November,
                            December and January) as summertime pollution often spikes due to the arid weather and increased dust particles in the air.
